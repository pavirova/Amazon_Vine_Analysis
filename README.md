# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview 
This analysis consisted of using PySpark along with Google Collab and Amazon Web Services(AWS) to perform an ETL on a music dataset where we extract, transform and connect the data to an AWS RDS instance to load the transformed data into a PGAdmin database where we can then use PySpark to perform calculations on Amazon Vine music reviews.
